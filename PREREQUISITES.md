# PREREQUISITES FOR RUNNING dns_docker

* Linux (obviously.) Distro doesn't matter.
* Docker (duh.) - CE Repos required on CentOS 7 and 8
  * Seriously though, you need Docker 19.x or higher
* Docker Compose 3.7 or above
* Basic understanding of DNS - if you know that "." is the root of all DNS, github.com is a domain, and www.github.com is a site, you can pick up the rest
* bash shell (not installed by default on Alpine)
* haveged must be installed and running *OR EVERYTHING WILL SUCK*
* ... yes also on hardware hosts!
* A text editor. ed(1) is recommended because [ED IS THE STANDARD!!!](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs249/Resources/ed_is_the_standard_text_editor.html)
* ... vi is also acceptable I guess.
* The ability to read this list of prerequisites and standard text files
* A cookie (this is optional but recommended. Chocolate-chocolate chip is nice.)
